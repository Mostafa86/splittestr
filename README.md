Bayesian and frequentist A/B split testing
--------------------

Functions for Bayesian and frequentist A/B split testing.

The main purpose of this package is to provide functions and support for [this blog post about Bayesian A/B testing](http://varianceexplained.org/r/bayesian-ab-testing/). The functions thus focus on particular kinds of simulation and approximations useful in the post. It is not intended or documented to be used by others, though it certainly can be.
